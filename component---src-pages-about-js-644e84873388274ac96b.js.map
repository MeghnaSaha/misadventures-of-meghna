While I work full time as a Software Engineer at Google,\n          I blog to unwind. Well, partially to unwind, and partially because I feel it would be the greatest \n          atrocity of all time to keep from the world my tales of misadventurous adventures.\n          <br/>\n          <br/>\n          I was born in the city of old worldly charm, Kolkata. I was the only child of two perenially working \n          parents, but I seldom remember myself being lonely. I was raised there until I came to Mumbai in the year \n          2005. I completed the rest of my schooling in Mumbai, where my hobbies included watching Pavitra Rishta on\n          TV, reading novels, mall hopping, window shopping and actively avoiding fast balls and sport grounds. When\n          the time came, like most students with no idea of what they wish to pursue, I took up the Sciences. Soon, \n          I ended up in an engineering college in a quaint little city called Bhubaneswar.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          College was a whirlwind of memories, each leaving behind a bittersweet taste. There were so many societies \n          to join, so many fests to attend, so many activities to partake in, and so little time. I consistently tried \n          to broaden my horizons by trying my hand at almost anything and everything. Soon came the happy realization, \n          that I wasn't really the jack of all trades. So I went ahead and bought myself a glass box, to sit inside and \n          look at the world from. \n          <br/>\n          <br/>\n          I identify myself as a not so discreet passive observer with a crap ton of half baked opinons. As life goes on, \n          with me in it, I see so much around me that never fails to amaze me, that never fails to amuse me. I invite you \n          to come along with me in my journey, as I write about whatever I can make of the world as I view it inside my \n          little glass box with my pink tinted glasses on!\n        </p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </Layout>\n)\n\nexport default About","// extracted by mini-css-extract-plugin\nmodule.exports = {\"container\":\"about-module--container--17zLm\",\"aboutContent\":\"about-module--aboutContent--3Cjgo\",\"shake\":\"about-module--shake--2k2Ni\"};","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/aboutpage1-bae8c092109ca47cd524b9b7f46b887c.jpg\";"],"sourceRoot":""}
