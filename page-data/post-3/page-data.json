The first speech that a member is supposed to start off with is the Icebreaker speech whose objective is to introduce the speaker to club. I joined Agnels Toastmasters club in Mumbai in the midst of the global pandemic - due to which this speech was delivered in an online mode. It was a nerve-wracking experience yet wholesome experience. The icing on the cake was that I ended up winning the Best Speaker award that night!</em></p>\n<p>If my life was a song, it would be the chaotic notes of a Tony Kakkar single. If my life was a food, it would be the amicable, all-complementing Domino’s garlic bread. And if my life was a book, it would remain untranslated. You ask why? Well, Good Evening, Susandhya, Guten Abend to all you esteemed Toastmasters – and welcome to my story!</p>\n<p>Almost 23 years ago, I was born in Kolkata – the city of old worldly charm. Toddler Meghna was a happy kid – crying, pooping &#x26; slurping my way through bowls of cerelac, I grew up – a single child born to the two most perennially working parents of this planet. But it was from them, that I learnt my mother tongue Bangla. Bangla was the language that first hit my ears, the language that I learnt to cry in &#x26; later to speak, and now, many years later still fall back to at moments of candid vulnerability, or at times when I have to cry out “Uri Baba” at the touch of a too-hot bhatura.</p>\n<p>All went steady for the next few years, until my parents – young professionals at that time – decided to move to Mumbai. For a starry-eyed 7 year old kid, the city of dreams seemed to open its arms in welcome &#x26; so did its people. In my new all-English fancy ICSE school, my class teacher had 2 rules –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>No chitchatting &#x26; </li>\n<li>No chitchatting in Hindi\nI was the teachers’ pet – not because I completed those confounding sets of homework assignments on time, but because, in the hue and cry of moving cities, the Bengali in me had never learnt to speak any Hindi! </li>\n</ol>\n<p><em>Meghna 0, Language 1</em></p>\n<p>Fitting in was no cakewalk, but what all Hindi tutors deemed impossible, Sony Entertainment Television achieved through its crash course in Hindi with nothing but a regular dose of Pavitra Rishta at 9 PM daily. Marathi was a completely different story – however hard I tried I could never go beyond the basics of ikde, tikde, maage &#x26; pude. </p>\n<p><em>Meghna 0, Language 2</em></p>\n<p>Struggling along, life went on &#x26; I soon found myself ikde-tikde-ing towards what’s Mecca for the clueless Indian student community – Engineering!\nAfter 2 whole years of gut-wrenching, soul-sucking grind through the infamous JEE-Mains &#x26; JEE-Advanced, I found myself at the golden gates of the magnificent IIT – Indian Institute of Technology Bhubaneswar. I thought to myself – “My life is set!”, but little did I know that this was to be a lesson in humility as I fell face first into Odia-land. People said Odia as a language had ample similarities with Bengali, fueled by which I used to converse in Odia with an innate confidence.</p>\n<p>There used to be a truck that ferried food to and fro our hostel messes. To get a ride on our way back from college, we used to ambush it enroute &#x26; hop in, asking the young driver “Shopping Complex jibo? Will you go to the Shopping Complex?”. It took me 2 years &#x26; 1 real Odia friend to realize that what I had been using instead was “Shopping Complex jiba?” which literally translated to “Shopping Complex? Let’s go!”. Now, the puzzled uncomfortable expressions on the truck driver’s face make a lot more sense. No, I wish I was joking.</p>\n<p><em>Meghna 0, Language 3</em></p>\n<p>College days flew past, with me failing at one language after another. I moved to Germany for some part of my semester and the only German I picked up is “Bitte English” meaning “English please!”. At college, I also met the love of my life, or so my 22 year old self hopes &#x26; he is as far from my tolerable language spectrum as RCB is from lifting the trophy at any IPL finals. He is a Malayali &#x26; I have already made peace with the fact that my vocabulary would begin at “idli” &#x26; end at “Malayalam illa!”.</p>\n<p><em>Meghna 0, Language – why are we still keeping count?</em></p>\n<p>How ironical is it, that eventually I wound up as a software developer – learning the nuances of 1 new programming language every day at work. Turns out, I was just bad at the human languages, I’m doing fine with the machines. </p>\n<p>While not having been able to learn all of the languages that I could have is a ship that’s long sailed, here I am at Agnel Toastmasters, aiming to conquer at least one of those. With this icebreaker, I have taken my first step forward – I have scooped up my ice, ground it into pieces, poured kala-khatta all over &#x26; served to you – a slice of my life. I hope you enjoyed! And if you have, what can I say, it’s just Meghna 1 Language 0.</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/post-3","title":"Meghna 1, Language 0 - Toastmasters Icebreaker Speech","date":"16 October, 2021"}}},"pageContext":{}}}
