As a sidenote, I would like to remark that though I got selected to be a memeber of the society, my time there was pretty uneventful. What made it worth the effort was the handful of friends I happened to make through the society.</em></p>\n<p>~.~.~ <strong>Sarcastic yet unfictional, not intended to hurt anyone</strong> ~.~.~</p>\n<p>After looking for inspiration in all the wrong places to complete my unplagarised  Panacea article for almost over a month, here, I finally present to you, Ladies and Gentlemen, the most clich√©d topic ever: My Life at IIT Bhubaneswar.\nSo, even though I've never stepped foot into KGP or Toshali, I, with my whopping experience of two months in tow, proceed to tell you my journey.</p>\n<p><strong>The Campus:</strong></p>\n<p>At the first look, which is obviously on Google, IIT Bhubaneswar will appear to be a scenery cut straight out of M.F. Hussain's canvas. Coming here, the canvas slowly appears to change hands from M.F. Hussain to my second grader kid sister. Firstly, you start to realise that even though its one of the largest campuses in India, its enormity is rather oblong. Buildings arranged neatly in a single line with enough space in between to fit two IIT Indores, you'll understand its majesty when the Bus Bhaina drives off leaving you stranded at one end of the campus and your destination is at the other. In such a situation, there are two cases that might happen - one, the weather might be the most wonderful one that you've ever seen, with a cloudy sky and a rainbow peeking, or, two, the weather might be the sunniest with 80% risk of the heat liquefying and evaporating you straight into hell. If its the latter, hard luck, but if its the former, refrain from thinking that you've hit the jackpot because if you just blink twice, and the weather will have turned into the dreaded latter.</p>\n<p><strong>The Hostel:</strong></p>\n<p>Its your home for the next four years. You can think of it as your own apartment - one bedroom, attached balcony, unattached toilet and kitchen. It isn't just four walls with ten previous occupants, it soon turns into your \"space\", which ofcourse is as untidy as Einstein's hair because your Mom ain't here. Moving on, we have our mess- brimming with potato, devoid of salt. They have such a versatile menu that dal-chawal has become my staple. Ofcourse, there are special dishes on certain days, including sweets. Ah, the sweets! Their sizes are such, they'd put the dimensions of your average electron or proton to shame. Come night, and you'll have a pretty capricious army of insects coming creeping and crawling into your room. Close as many doors and windows you want, but there'll always be a grasshopper waiting at the sink, a moth cozy in your bed, or a toad hopping away  gayly in your balcony.</p>\n<p><strong>The People:</strong> </p>\n<p>Out of every hundred people you meet here, eighty are bound to be Telegu and one, a girl. And then, there'll be your seniors - very \"interactive\" and your professors - not so interactive. And just when you'll be fitting into your daily routine of meetings and inductions, out of nowhere, the midsems will come dashing, splat on your face.</p>\n<p><strong>The MidSems:</strong> </p>\n<p>This is the most fun part. You'll see the already scanty population on the streets turn scantier. The days will seem shorter, the nights sleepier. You'll read at Usain Bolt speed the night before, or atleast you'll try to. Then you'll realize that there's life after Midsems, promise to study harder after it, and go to sleep.</p>\n<p>Well, this might seem to short to accommodate an entire IIT Bbs experience, but sooner or later, you'll realize there's nothing else to life here. Alright, I'm kidding. Ofcourse, there will be an occasional city visit here, a fest or two there, or even a super rare good-mess-food day, and you'll be having to thrive on that. </p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/post-2","title":"Of Frogs, Bhainas, Entis and Perentis: A fresher's perspective of IIT Bhubaneswar","date":"23 July, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{}}}
