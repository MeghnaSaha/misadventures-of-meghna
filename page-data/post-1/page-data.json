I shouted \"Hey you!\". But the giraffe paid no heed and went ahead to a third mouthful. I threw my people eating fork at him and it found its mark somewhere around the bottom half of its neck. I skinned it and boiled it and fed it to my family. The meat was juicy but soon everyone in my family grew <strong>long necks</strong> and tiny tails. We were proud of our curly tails but the necks, oh the necks! The necks grew and grew and grew so much that soon, we needed to coil our necks to avoid getting them entangled like earphone cords.
