I shouted \"Hey you!\". But the giraffe paid no heed and went ahead to a third mouthful. I threw my people eating fork at him and it found its mark somewhere around the bottom half of its neck. I skinned it and boiled it and fed it to my family. The meat was juicy but soon everyone in my family grew <strong>long necks</strong> and tiny tails. We were proud of our curly tails but the necks, oh the necks! The necks grew and grew and grew so much that soon, we needed to coil our necks to avoid getting them entangled like earphone cords. Food too took a much longer time to go in, and that made me sad. Finally I concluded that eating a giraffe wasn't the brightest of all ideas, and ever since I've stuck to eating short necked hens.</p>","excerpt":"This was a test post I wrote while building this blog project.

As a sidenote, I would like to remark that though I got selected to be a memeber of the society, my time there was pretty uneventful. What made it worth the effort was the handful of friends I happened to make through the society.</em></p>\n<p>~.~.~ <strong>Sarcastic yet unfictional, not intended to hurt anyone</strong> ~.~.~</p>\n<p>After looking for inspiration in all the wrong places to complete my unplagarised  Panacea article for almost over a month, here, I finally present to you, Ladies and Gentlemen, the most clichéd topic ever: My Life at IIT Bhubaneswar.\nSo, even though I've never stepped foot into KGP or Toshali, I, with my whopping experience of two months in tow, proceed to tell you my journey.</p>\n<p><strong>The Campus:</strong></p>\n<p>At the first look, which is obviously on Google, IIT Bhubaneswar will appear to be a scenery cut straight out of M.F. Hussain's canvas. Coming here, the canvas slowly appears to change hands from M.F. Hussain to my second grader kid sister. Firstly, you start to realise that even though its one of the largest campuses in India, its enormity is rather oblong. Buildings arranged neatly in a single line with enough space in between to fit two IIT Indores, you'll understand its majesty when the Bus Bhaina drives off leaving you stranded at one end of the campus and your destination is at the other. In such a situation, there are two cases that might happen - one, the weather might be the most wonderful one that you've ever seen, with a cloudy sky and a rainbow peeking, or, two, the weather might be the sunniest with 80% risk of the heat liquefying and evaporating you straight into hell. If its the latter, hard luck, but if its the former, refrain from thinking that you've hit the jackpot because if you just blink twice, and the weather will have turned into the dreaded latter.</p>\n<p><strong>The Hostel:</strong></p>\n<p>Its your home for the next four years. You can think of it as your own apartment - one bedroom, attached balcony, unattached toilet and kitchen. It isn't just four walls with ten previous occupants, it soon turns into your \"space\", which ofcourse is as untidy as Einstein's hair because your Mom ain't here. Moving on, we have our mess- brimming with potato, devoid of salt. They have such a versatile menu that dal-chawal has become my staple. Ofcourse, there are special dishes on certain days, including sweets. Ah, the sweets! Their sizes are such, they'd put the dimensions of your average electron or proton to shame. Come night, and you'll have a pretty capricious army of insects coming creeping and crawling into your room. Close as many doors and windows you want, but there'll always be a grasshopper waiting at the sink, a moth cozy in your bed, or a toad hopping away  gayly in your balcony.</p>\n<p><strong>The People:</strong> </p>\n<p>Out of every hundred people you meet here, eighty are bound to be Telegu and one, a girl. And then, there'll be your seniors - very \"interactive\" and your professors - not so interactive. And just when you'll be fitting into your daily routine of meetings and inductions, out of nowhere, the midsems will come dashing, splat on your face.</p>\n<p><strong>The MidSems:</strong> </p>\n<p>This is the most fun part. You'll see the already scanty population on the streets turn scantier. The days will seem shorter, the nights sleepier. You'll read at Usain Bolt speed the night before, or atleast you'll try to. Then you'll realize that there's life after Midsems, promise to study harder after it, and go to sleep.</p>\n<p>Well, this might seem to short to accommodate an entire IIT Bbs experience, but sooner or later, you'll realize there's nothing else to life here. Alright, I'm kidding. Ofcourse, there will be an occasional city visit here, a fest or two there, or even a super rare good-mess-food day, and you'll be having to thrive on that. </p>","excerpt":"This was my submission for getting into my college's Literary Society, Panacea.

The first speech that a member is supposed to start off with is the Icebreaker speech whose objective is to introduce the speaker to club. I joined Agnels Toastmasters club in Mumbai in the midst of the global pandemic - due to which this speech was delivered in an online mode. It was a nerve-wracking experience yet wholesome experience. The icing on the cake was that I ended up winning the Best Speaker award that night!</em></p>\n<p>If my life was a song, it would be the chaotic notes of a Tony Kakkar single. If my life was a food, it would be the amicable, all-complementing Domino’s garlic bread. And if my life was a book, it would remain untranslated. You ask why? Well, Good Evening, Susandhya, Guten Abend to all you esteemed Toastmasters – and welcome to my story!</p>\n<p>Almost 23 years ago, I was born in Kolkata – the city of old worldly charm. Toddler Meghna was a happy kid – crying, pooping &#x26; slurping my way through bowls of cerelac, I grew up – a single child born to the two most perennially working parents of this planet. But it was from them, that I learnt my mother tongue Bangla. Bangla was the language that first hit my ears, the language that I learnt to cry in &#x26; later to speak, and now, many years later still fall back to at moments of candid vulnerability, or at times when I have to cry out “Uri Baba” at the touch of a too-hot bhatura.</p>\n<p>All went steady for the next few years, until my parents – young professionals at that time – decided to move to Mumbai. For a starry-eyed 7 year old kid, the city of dreams seemed to open its arms in welcome &#x26; so did its people. In my new all-English fancy ICSE school, my class teacher had 2 rules –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>No chitchatting &#x26; </li>\n<li>No chitchatting in Hindi\nI was the teachers’ pet – not because I completed those confounding sets of homework assignments on time, but because, in the hue and cry of moving cities, the Bengali in me had never learnt to speak any Hindi! </li>\n</ol>\n<p><em>Meghna 0, Language 1</em></p>\n<p>Fitting in was no cakewalk, but what all Hindi tutors deemed impossible, Sony Entertainment Television achieved through its crash course in Hindi with nothing but a regular dose of Pavitra Rishta at 9 PM daily. Marathi was a completely different story – however hard I tried I could never go beyond the basics of ikde, tikde, maage &#x26; pude. </p>\n<p><em>Meghna 0, Language 2</em></p>\n<p>Struggling along, life went on &#x26; I soon found myself ikde-tikde-ing towards what’s Mecca for the clueless Indian student community – Engineering!\nAfter 2 whole years of gut-wrenching, soul-sucking grind through the infamous JEE-Mains &#x26; JEE-Advanced, I found myself at the golden gates of the magnificent IIT – Indian Institute of Technology Bhubaneswar. I thought to myself – “My life is set!”, but little did I know that this was to be a lesson in humility as I fell face first into Odia-land. People said Odia as a language had ample similarities with Bengali, fueled by which I used to converse in Odia with an innate confidence.</p>\n<p>There used to be a truck that ferried food to and fro our hostel messes. To get a ride on our way back from college, we used to ambush it enroute &#x26; hop in, asking the young driver “Shopping Complex jibo? Will you go to the Shopping Complex?”. It took me 2 years &#x26; 1 real Odia friend to realize that what I had been using instead was “Shopping Complex jiba?” which literally translated to “Shopping Complex? Let’s go!”. Now, the puzzled uncomfortable expressions on the truck driver’s face make a lot more sense. No, I wish I was joking.</p>\n<p><em>Meghna 0, Language 3</em></p>\n<p>College days flew past, with me failing at one language after another. I moved to Germany for some part of my semester and the only German I picked up is “Bitte English” meaning “English please!”. At college, I also met the love of my life, or so my 22 year old self hopes &#x26; he is as far from my tolerable language spectrum as RCB is from lifting the trophy at any IPL finals. He is a Malayali &#x26; I have already made peace with the fact that my vocabulary would begin at “idli” &#x26; end at “Malayalam illa!”.</p>\n<p><em>Meghna 0, Language – why are we still keeping count?</em></p>\n<p>How ironical is it, that eventually I wound up as a software developer – learning the nuances of 1 new programming language every day at work. Turns out, I was just bad at the human languages, I’m doing fine with the machines. </p>\n<p>While not having been able to learn all of the languages that I could have is a ship that’s long sailed, here I am at Agnel Toastmasters, aiming to conquer at least one of those. With this icebreaker, I have taken my first step forward – I have scooped up my ice, ground it into pieces, poured kala-khatta all over &#x26; served to you – a slice of my life. I hope you enjoyed! And if you have, what can I say, it’s just Meghna 1 Language 0.</p>","excerpt":"Toastmasters International is a well-known nonprofit educational organization that operates clubs worldwide for the purpose of promoting…"}},{"node":{"id":"5004a141-357f-5e09-8dbc-b89db454dcee","frontmatter":{"path":"/post-4","title":"Meghna & Mister","date":"25 December, 2021"},"html":"<p><em>A recount of my adventures at a dating show, that happened in NeverLand: this was my enty for the club level Tall Tales (stories that are told as if they were true but contain exaggerated or unbelievable parts) Contest at my Toastmasters Club. It was my first ever contest &#x26; while I ended up not winning, I had a great experience participating.</em></p>\n<p>Many years before the advent of Tinder, the way that people found their soulmates was through a good old-fashioned Swayamvar. After the sensational Rakhi ka Swayamvar that aired on Indian Television, there was another mystery show on the same concept called “Meghna &#x26; Mister” &#x26; of course, the producers just had to ask the most youthful, most ingenious, most delightful girl on the planet &#x26; after checking my calendar, I said yes to the show!</p>\n<p>The show’s concept was simple – a series of elimination rounds with 20 eligible bachelors each with 1 heart shaped bulb that had to be turned on if we were a match. So, in I walked – swish-swash swish-swash in a shiny silver dress, and as I got to the center-stage, I felt all the bulbs turning on! </p>\n<p>The 1st round involved the organizers showing a video montage of my life. We all turned to the big screen &#x26; saw great moments of my existence get replayed – me watching Bigg Boss at 12 AM, me eating pineapple pizzas &#x26; me vibing to Dhinchak Pooja’s songs. The men however did not seem to be in agreement &#x26; 10 of them turned off their bulbs! Huh! If they cannot appreciate my cultured hobbies, good riddance!</p>\n<p>The 2nd round was to be a video testimony collected from a mystery person. We all turned to the big screen again &#x26; I was surprised to see my friendly old neighbor who had once asked me to take care of his pet goldfish in his absence. But as soon as he came onscreen, he started hurling abuses at me, saying I had pan fried his pet goldfish &#x26; eaten it for dinner! Well, in my defense wasn’t that what he meant by “taking care of it”? After all, I was just acting as per my Bengali roots! I don’t know what I did wrong, but the damage was done &#x26; 5 more dissuaded boys turned off their bulbs.</p>\n<p>There were now 20-10-5 = 2 boys left, and if you’re following the Math &#x26; it doesn’t add up, well, I would urge you to put your calculator &#x26; sense of logic back into your pockets – this contest is called Tall Tales for a reason!</p>\n<p>The 3rd and final round was the “Get to Know Each Other” segment. The 1st guy looked like an Indian Chris Hemsworth &#x26; it was love at first sight until he said “I am strictly vegetarian, but on Tuesdays I eat eggs, on Wednesdays I eat hens &#x26; ducks, on Thursdays I eat frogs..” and before he could recite his menu for the rest of the week I turned off his bulb.</p>\n<p>With all hopes now pinned on the final Mister, I turned to him with expectant eyes. His introduction was smooth, he was some oratory genius sweeping me off my feet, which is until he mentioned “I am the terrific President of the most terrific Speaking Club of Honolulu”. I cut him off right there – “Terrific for you, Mr. Honolulu, but I am from Toastmasters &#x26; I disagree that there can be any club more terrific than Toastmasters! T for Terrific, T for Toastmasters!” And just then, I felt a shift in the room’s energy as ecstatic whispers of “Toastmasters! Toastmasters! She’s from Toastmasters!” took over the arena &#x26; all the Misters switched on their bulbs in awe! </p>\n<p>While I did not find my Mister that day on the sets of “Meghna &#x26; Mister”, let me tell you what I learnt: be it a dating show or a job interview or a Tall Tales Contest, being a Toastmaster will take you places!</p>","excerpt":"A recount of my adventures at a dating show, that happened in NeverLand: this was my enty for the club level Tall Tales (stories that are…"}}]}},"pageContext":{}}}
